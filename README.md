# Welcome to Rendr

Rendr is a small library from [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) that allows you to run your [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) apps seamlessly on both the client and the server. Allow your web server to serve fully-formed HTML pages to any deep link of your app, while preserving the snappy feel of a traditional Backbone.js client-side MVC app.


# Getting Started

1. At the command prompt, create a new Rendr application

        rendr new myapp

2. Change directory to `myapp`

        cd myapp

3. Install the required npm modules

        npm install

4. Start the server

        grunt server

## Hasp Usage

You can see the Hasp usage in the **home controller's** index action.
